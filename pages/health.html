				<h2>Drinking tea may improve your health — here's what to try</h2>	
			</div>
			<div class="health1">
				<h3>1. Tea contains antioxidants.</h3>
				<p>Antioxidants work to prevent the body’s version of rust and thus help to keep us young and protect us from damage from pollution. <br>Load up on antioxidants with a white tea, which is less processed than black or green tea so it retains more beneficial antioxidants.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="health2">
				<h3>2. Tea has less caffeine than coffee.</h3>
				<p>Herbal blends have no caffeine, while traditional teas have less than 50% of what typically is found in coffee. <br>That means you can consume it without those pesky effects on your nervous system, says Leslie Bonci, nutritionist and <br>owner of Active Eating Advice. If you're trying to switch from coffee to tea, try a chicory root tea like Teeccino, which has<br> a mouth feel and flavor similar to coffee. Chicory root is also known to help reduce stress and is a prebiotic so may <br>be helpful to your gut.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="health3">
				<h3>3. Tea may reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke</h3>
				<p>A study published in 2016 that combined data from a host of earlier reports found a nearly 20% reduction in the <br>risk of heart attack and a 35% reduced risk of stroke among those who drank one to three cups of green tea a day. Those who drank<br> four or more cups of green tea daily had a 32% reduction in the risk of having a heart attack and lower levels of<br> LDL cholesterol.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="health4">
				<h3>4. Tea may keep your smile bright</h3>
				<p>“Japanese researchers have found that tea can decrease tooth loss,” Ardine said. “It changes the pH in your<br> mouth when you drink it and that may be what prevents cavities.” Beyond that, tea, unlike many other beverages does not appear<br> to erode tooth enamel, Bonci said.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="health5">
				<h3>5. Tea may boost the immune system</h3>
				<p>Studies have shown tea can tune up immune cells so they reach their targets quicker. Holy basil or tulsi tea has <br>been used by Ayurvedic practitioners for centuries to help keep the immune system strong after injuries or illnesses thanks<br> to its antibacterial, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
